 * debug bytes and from which it will read.
 *
 * The RECOMMENDED way (please don't do it otherwise) is to define these values in the
 * section "Simulation options" of this project's Makefile. In the Makefile, you
 * should define the vars. "SIM_WRITE_ADDR" and "SIM_READ_ADDR", which will affect
 * the macros used here.
